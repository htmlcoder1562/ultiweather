Have you ever wanted to know the weather at all times? Well, then this is for you! We have you use weatherapi.com because you get a free trial of a maximum of 5,000,000 calls to thier API a month, and 1,000,000 per month for free after the free trial is over! That's a lot of calls! And thier API is up almost %100 of the time! And if that's crazy, then I'll tell you that you can look in the past, future, or even the current temperature, which is what this code is currently set to do. Now that you know what's happening, happy coding!
